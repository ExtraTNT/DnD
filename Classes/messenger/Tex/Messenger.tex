	\section{Introduction}
	The Messenger class is a homebrew D\&D class, which is great for oneshots. The focus is on roleplay and variety. The class is designed in such a way that all specialties are covered by the subclass. The main class does not say anything about a character. No guarantee that this class will not result in potentially unbalanced creations when multiclassing or using certain races.\doublelinebreak
	\chapter{Messenger}
	\DndDropCapLine{A} messenger is a representative who works for a higher creature or region. His job is to communicate and negotiate with other higher creatures and regions. How a messenger gets his job can be different. Maybe he applied for a job in a monastery, maybe he is religious and a god has spoken to him. But maybe a god saved his life and now he is in his debt. The messenger is usually the mysterious person in the party. He is the one who does the talking during conversations and gets other people to do what brings benefits to him. Why he helps someone is not always obvious, but he seems to be serious about what he does.

Your Spell Cast Ability Number (SCAN) recovers after a longrest.
