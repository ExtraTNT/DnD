# Cania

As a messenger from Cania you are familiar with the harsh temperatures of this ice-hell. You basically follow the laws, even if they are not those of the current region. You can be very unpredictable at times. Your alignment is mainly evil, but can also be different.

   - lvl 1: ice shield
    	- if you are attacked, you are able to pull as a reaction an ice shield from the ground, which can have a size of max 10 ft x 10ft x 1ft. It can be casted (prof bonus) times per long rest. An opponent must destroy the ice shield or go around it. (resistance against ice dmg, vulnerablility against fire dmg). The shield has 15 hitpoints and a AC of 13, which increases with certain levels in this class. On level 5 there is 23 hitpoints, on level 9 it is 31 hitpoints, on level 13 it is 39 hitpoints, on level 17 it is 45 hitpoints and on level 20 it is 60 hitpoints. If the damage delt to the shield exceeds the hitpoints of the shield, the shield absorbs the damage and gets destroyed.
   - wild magic
       - Because you come from a plane of the nine hells, your magic is very unstable. You have a 20% change that your magic goes wild. If your magic goes wild, you will instead cast something that is written on your wild magic sheet. Put your wild magic sheet together with your DM or at least let him look over it.
