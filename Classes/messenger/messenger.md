[[Cania]]
[[Feywild]]
[[Arvandor]]

| Origin     | Focus          | Mainfeature                       |
|------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Mechanus   | Spellcasting   | Cantrips and multiple Spell Lists |
| Phlegethos | Do Damage      | Fireattack                        |
| Cania      | Tank           | Ice-Shield                        |
| Feywild    | Ranged Attacks | Proficencies                      |
| Arvandor   | Support        | Holy-Healing                      |

## Spellcasting
Starting at Level 1, you are able to cast Spells. Your Origin decides which Spells you can cast. Your Spell List contains 3 Spells. The First Spell gets your lowes Spell Slot, your Second Spell the middle one and your Third Spell the highest. If you want to cast a Spell, you roll your Spell Cast Dice(s) and reduce your Spell Cast Ability Number by the rolled result. If the Spell Cast Ability Number is now equal or higher than 0 you can cast, if your Spell Cast Ability Number gets below 0 you can not cast (you can make a Charisma-save (dc 15) to redo the last roll, this will end your turn but you can eventually cast in the next round). Your Spell Cast Ability Number recovers after a Longrest.  

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
