	\section{Wood Woad Traits}
	\textbf{Ability Score Increase.} Your Constitution score increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\linebreak
	\textbf{Age.} Sprouting 3 days after the ritual completes, wood woads mature into their humanoid shape very quickly over a few months, and can exist seemingly indefinitely unless destroyed.\linebreak
	\textbf{Alignment.} They tend towards lawful neutral.\linebreak
	\textbf{Size.} Wood Woad's stand between 4 and 7 feet tall and average about 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.\linebreak
	\textbf{Speed.} Your base walking speed is 30ft.\linebreak
	\textbf{Language.} You can read, write and speak Sylvan and Common.\linebreak
	\textbf{Vulnerability.} Fire\linebreak
	\textbf{Living Plant.} You count as a plant type creature.\linebreak
	\textbf{Plant Camouflage.} You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in any terrain with ample obscuring plant life.\linebreak
	\textbf{Darkvision.} You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\linebreak
	\textbf{Photosynthesis.} Instead of eating or sleeping, you benefit from a long rest after 4 hours staying at one spot, absorbing water, nutrients, air, and bright light to perform photosynthesis.
	\textbf{Defensive.} If you take the dodge action, you benefit from a adittional +5 ac against non magical bludgening, piercing and slashing damage.\linebreak
